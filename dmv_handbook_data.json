Do not drive on or over this barrier, make a left turn, or make a U-turn across it, except at designated openings.\nA broken yellow line indicates you may pass if the broken line is next to your driving lane. Only pass when it is safe.\nA single solid white line marks traffic lanes going in the same direction. This includes one-way streets.\nDouble solid white lines indicate a lane barrier between a regular use and a preferential use lane, such as a carpool (HOV) lane. You may also see double solid white lines in or near freeway on and off ramps. Never change lanes over double solid white lines. Wait until you see a single broken white line.\nBroken white lines separate traffic lanes on roads with two or more lanes in the same direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnding freeway and street lanes are usually marked with large broken lines. If you are driving in a lane marked with broken lines, be prepared to exit the freeway or for the lane to end. Look for a sign that tells you to exit or merge.\nA yield line is a line of solid white triangles that shows approaching vehicles where to yield or stop. The triangles point towards approaching vehicles.\nTraffic lanes are often referred to by number. The left (or fast) lane is called the Number 1 Lane. The lane to the right of the Number 1 Lane is called the Number 2 Lane.

The vehicle that arrives to the intersection first has the right-of-way. Other vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians must wait for the person who has the right-of-way. Never assume that other drivers will give you the right-of-way. Give up your right-of-way when it will help prevent collisions.\nAn intersection is any place where one road meets another road. Controlled intersections have signs or traffic signal lights. Uncontrolled and blind intersections do not. Before entering an intersection, look left, right, and ahead to check for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Be prepared to slow down and stop if necessary. Pedestrians always have the right-of-way. Here are some right-of-way rules at intersections:\nWithout STOP or YIELD signs: The vehicle that arrives to the intersection first has the right-of-way. However, if a vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclist gets to the intersection at the same time as you, give the right-of-way to the vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclist on your right. If you approach a stop sign and there is a stop sign on all four corners, stop first and proceed as above.\nT intersections without STOP or YIELD signs: Vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians on the through road (continuing to go straight) have the right-of-way.\nTurning left: Check for pedestrians. Give the right-of-way to any pedestrian or approaching vehicle that is close enough to be dangerous.\nTurning right: Always check for pedestrians crossing the street, and motorcycles and bicycles riding next to you.\nGreen traffic signal light: Proceed with caution. Pedestrians have the right-of-way.\nEntering traffic: When entering traffic, you must proceed with caution and yield to the traffic already occupying the lanes. It is against the law to stop or block an intersection where there is not enough space to completely cross before the traffic signal light turns red.\nIn a roundabout, traffic travels in one direction around a central island.\nHow to use a roundabout:\nSlow down as you approach.\nYield to all traffic already in the roundabout.\nEnter heading to the right when there is a big enough gap in traffic to merge safely.\nWatch for signs and lane markings that guide you.\nTravel in a counter-clockwise direction. Do not stop or pass.\nSignal when you change lanes or exit.\nIf you miss your exit, continue around until you return to your exit.\nIf the roundabout has multiple lanes, choose your entry or exit lane based on your destination. This is shown in the image below. To:\nTurn right (yellow car): Choose the right lane and exit in the right lane.\nGo straight (red car): Choose either lane.

But they also have large blind spots, also called No Zones. In these areas, your vehicle can disappear from a large vehicle or truck driver’s view. If you cannot see the truck’s side mirrors, the truck driver cannot see you.\nLarge vehicles and commercial trucks take longer to stop than passenger vehicles traveling at the same speed. When traveling, they create extra space in front of their vehicle to use if they need to stop suddenly. The average passenger vehicle traveling at 55 mph can stop within 300 feet. A large vehicle traveling at the same speed can take up to 400 feet to stop. The heavier the vehicle and the faster it is moving, the longer it takes to safely stop, so a loaded truck will take longer to stop than an empty truck. Do not move in front of a large vehicle and suddenly slow down or stop. The large vehicle will not be able to stop fast enough to avoid crashing into you.\nWhen a vehicle turns, the rear wheels follow a shorter path than the front wheels. The longer the vehicle, the greater the difference in the length of the turning path. This is why large vehicles and truck drivers must often swing wide to complete a turn. When you follow a large vehicle, look at its turn signals before you start to pass. It may appear to be turning one direction but instead is swinging wide in the opposite direction in order to turn.\nLarge vehicles and trucks are not as easy to maneuver as passenger vehicles. On a divided highway with four or more traffic lanes in one direction, they may be driven in the two lanes farthest to the right. When driving near large vehicles and trucks, do not:\nChange lanes directly in front of them to reach an exit or turn.\nDrive next to them longer than you need to. Always pass a large vehicle on the left side. After you pass the large vehicle or truck, move ahead of it. Driving alongside a large vehicle makes it hard for the driver to avoid dangers in the road.\nFollow too closely. Tailgating decreases a vehicle’s safety distance.\nUnderestimate their size and speed as they often appear to be traveling slower.\nSafety zones are spaces set aside for pedestrians waiting for buses, streetcars, and trolleys. Safety zones are marked by raised buttons or markers on a road. Do not drive through a safety zone under any condition.\nWhen a bus, streetcar, or trolley is stopped at a safety zone or traffic light, you may pass at no more than 10 mph.\nDo not overtake and pass a light rail vehicle or streetcar on the left side, whether it is moving or standing, unless:",

In some cases, children under 8 years old may ride in the front seat of a vehicle in a federally-approved child passenger restraint system. They may ride in the front seat if:\n\nThere is no rear seat.\nThe rear seats are side-facing jump seats.\nThe rear seats are rear-facing seats.\nThe child passenger restraint system cannot be installed properly in the rear seat.\nAll rear seats are already occupied by children 7 years old or younger.\nMedical reasons prevent the child from riding in the back seat.\n\n\nChildren who are 8 years old or older, or at least 4 feet 9 inches tall: May use a properly secured safety belt that meets federal standards.\nYour local law enforcement agency or fire department can check the installation of your child passenger restraint system. As your child grows, check that the child passenger restraint system is the right size.\nAir bags are a valuable safety feature on many vehicles. They can help keep you safer than a seat belt alone.\nRide at least 10 inches from the airbag cover, as long as you can maintain full control of your vehicle. Measure from the center of the steering wheel to your breastbone. Contact your vehicle dealer or manufacturer if you cannot safely sit 10 inches away from the air bag. They may have advice about additional ways to move back from your air bag. Passengers should also sit at least 10 inches away from the passenger-side air bag.\nNote Children seated next to a side air bag may be at risk of serious or fatal injury.\nIt is illegal to leave a child who is six years old or younger unattended in a vehicle. A child may be left under the supervision of a person who is at least 12 years old.\nIt is dangerous and illegal to leave children or animals in a hot vehicle. The temperature inside a parked vehicle can rise rapidly when it is sitting in the sun. This is true even if a window is left slightly open. Too much exposure to heat can lead to dehydration, heat stroke, and death.",

Suddenly braking or abruptly removing your foot from the accelerator can result in a loss of control over the vehicle. Instead, you should take the following steps recommended by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration:\nHold the steering wheel with both hands.\nMaintain your vehicle speed if possible and safe.\nGradually release the accelerator.\nCorrect the steering as necessary to stabilize your vehicle and regain control.\nLook and steer in the direction you want your vehicle to go.\nOnce your vehicle has stabilized, continue to slow down and pull off the road where and when it’s safe.\nIf your wheels drift off the pavement:\nGrip the steering wheel firmly.\nRemove your foot from the accelerator.\nBrake gently.\nCheck for traffic behind you.\nCarefully steer back onto the pavement.\nDo not pull or turn your steering wheel with too much force. This may cause you to drive into oncoming traffic.\nIn extreme heat, you should:\nWatch the temperature gauge.\nAvoid driving at high speeds for long periods.\nTurn off the air conditioner.\nIn extreme cold, you should:\nWatch the temperature gauge. The engine may not have the correct level of antifreeze.\nUse the defroster or slightly open your windows to keep them from fogging up.\nNote See the vehicle owner’s manual for more information.\nIf your vehicle stops working on the freeway:\nSafely pull over to the right shoulder.\nExit on the right side so you are away from traffic if you must get out of the vehicle.\nDial 511 from your cell phone or locate call box for assistance..\nReturn to your vehicle as soon as you can. Get back into the vehicle from the right side (away from traffic).\nStay inside your vehicle with your seat belt on until help arrives.\nUse your emergency flashers at your discretion. They can help other vehicles see you at night and in different weather conditions.\nThere are certain circumstances where it is safer to get out of your vehicle and stay away. These include situations where there is:\nNot enough space on the shoulder.\nA guardrail.\nAn area for you to safely stay away from freeway lanes.\nDuring commute times, the CHP FSP provides free emergency roadside services in certain areas. If you get stuck on the freeway because your vehicle stops running, FSP will:\nProvide a gallon of gas if you run out.\nJump start your vehicle if the battery is dead.\nRefill your radiator and tape hoses.\nChange a flat tire.\nReport a collision to CHP.\nIf FSP cannot start your vehicle, they will have it towed (free of charge) to a CHP-approved location. CHP will notify an auto club or towing service.\nFSP will not:\nTow your vehicle to a private repair service or residence.\nRecommend tow service companies or repair and body shops.\nTow motorcycles.\nHelp vehicles which have been involved in a collision, unless they are directed to by CHP.\nCall 511 for FSP information and assistance.\nAvoid distractions while you drive.

    "content": "Before buying a vehicle, it is important to know your rights and responsibilities. There are various agencies that can provide you with information regarding the vehicle purchase process; however, there are things you can do to protect yourself before signing a contract.\nBe aware that there is no “cooling off” period on vehicles purchased from a dealer unless you obtain a contract cancellation option, which is available when buying specified used cars from a licensed California dealer.\nKnow and understand your rights as a consumer. See the Car Buyer’s Bill of Rights (FFVR 35) Fast Facts brochure.\nKnow the value of the vehicle you wish to buy. Check the value with a vehicle pricing guide, newspaper ads, Internet, or by comparison shopping.\nAll California dealers must have a National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) report to show you. For a private sale, you may obtain a NMVTIS report at www.vehiclehistory.gov for a nominal fee.\nRead and understand your purchase contract. Don’t sign anything you don’t understand.\nRead and understand the manufacturer’s warranty and any additional warranties (service contracts) offered by a dealer.\nIf a vehicle is partially self-driving, a California dealer must provide a list of partial driving automation features including descriptions of their functions and limitations. Features include collision avoidance systems, electronic blind spot assistance, automated emergency braking systems, park assist, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, traffic jam and queuing assist, and other similar systems that enhance safety or provide driver assistance but are not capable of driving the vehicle without the active control or monitoring of a human operator.\nCompare interest rates.\nUnderstand the DMV fees that are being charged to you.\nUnderstand that on vehicle documents an “or” between co-owners’ names indicates one owner can sell the vehicle without the other’s signature. When a slash (“/”) indicating “and,” appears between the owners’ names, the signature of each owner is required.\nUnderstand the restrictions when buying an out-of-state vehicle. See the Before Buying a Vehicle From Out of State – Can You Register It In California? (FFVR 29) Fast Facts  (PDF) brochure.\nCheck www.safercar.gov to find out if your vehicle has a safety recall notice that has not been repaired.",

    "content": "Students can take DE/DT in a California secondary school or in a state-licensed, professional driving school.\nTo ensure that your teenager receives the DE/DT they need, it’s important to select a driving school that you’re comfortable with, provides high-quality education and training, and employs instructors that are professional, respectful, and knowledgeable.\nHere are some tips to help you select a driving school:\nCheck the school’s license status on our Occupational License Lookup. The school must be licensed and bonded by the DMV. \nContact your local Better Business Bureau (BBB). Driving schools aren’t required to be a member, but the BBB website is a good source of information for customer complaints.\nCompare tuition costs between driving schools and ask about any additional fees or charges to have a clear understanding of all expenses.\nRetain copies of all receipts, contracts, and other school documents.\nMake sure the instructors are licensed and pass qualifying examinations every three years or show proof of continuing traffic safety education. Check the driving school instructor’s license status by calling DMV at (916) 229-3126.\nAsk about the school’s training vehicles. Training vehicles must be:\n\nEquipped with an instructor foot brake and an additional rear view mirror.\nInsured with the required bodily injury and property damage liability insurance.\nInspected yearly to ensure that the vehicle is in safe and proper mechanical condition.\nUsed for instruction only (instructors aren’t allowed to take breaks or conduct personal business during behind-the-wheel training).\n\n\nAsk the driving school for a telephone number you can use in case of an emergency (behind-the-wheel training often occurs when the driver training school is closed).\nAsk about the school’s policy for canceling or rescheduling a behind-the-wheel training session.\nChoose a driving school in an area you’re familiar with. It is easier to learn to drive when you know the streets.\nDriving school personnel should avoid any physical contact with your teenager, except in an emergency.\nDriver training schools establish their own policies regarding the following:\nProgram length and schedule.\nVideos and movies containing graphic scenes of traffic accidents (licensed schools are required to show at least 100 minutes of video).\nBehind-the-wheel driver training time requirements.\nDriver training routes.\nMake and model of driver training vehicles.\nDrop-off and pickup locations for training sessions.\nCheck with the driver training school for more information about these policies.",

Testing helps to determine a driver’s mental and/or physical condition, their ability to follow traffic laws and rules, and whether their DL is renewed, restricted, suspended, or revoked.\nAs we age, we change physically and mentally. These changes can and do affect our driving skills. Getting older does not automatically make us poor drivers. Many people continue to be safe drivers well into their golden years.\nThe DMV has a variety of additional services and support depending on your needs.",
